<H1> The Proper $\pi$ Manifesto</H1>
<H2> Preface </H2>
<p>
</p>
<H2> The circle constant </H2>
Recent debates about the proper definition for the circle constant are.
</p>
<H2> Darians are the best measure for angles</H2>
<p>A whole lot of formulas end up with the $2\pi$ coefficients as a result of using Radians. Radians measure the length of the arc along a circle with a radius $1$. The circumference of such circle is $2\pi$, and this results in $2\pi$ showing up everywhere. This is the wrong way to go about defining angles. 
</p>
<p>
The proper way to define angles is to use the arc of a unit circle with a diameter of length $1$. The circumference of this unit circle is exactly $\pi = 3.1415926...$. An angle $\alpha$ would be defined as the length of the arc along this circle. This is a simpler and much more natural definition for angles. One immediate consequence is a quarter of a circle being $\frac{\pi}{4}$, and the same is true for all parts of a circle.
</p>
<p>
We will call this system for measuring angles "Darians". Instead of the $rad$ symbol defining angles in radians, we would use the Greek letter Digamma $\digamma$.

<H2> The Diameter is the fundamental property of a circle</H2>
<p>
The reason darians are better measure for angles is that <b>the diameter is the fundamental property of the circle</b>. Rectangles aren't measured by distance from their center! either do triangles. The radius of a circle is not even a directly measurable property. Thus, the Greeks knew what they were doing while defining the circle constant as:
$$ \pi = \frac {Circumference}{Diameter} $$
</p>
<p>
Which holds for any circle.
</p>
<H2> Calculus agrees </H2>
<p>
Using this definition for angles, we get a better definition for $\sin (x)$ that uses Darians. For example $\sin (0)=\sin(\pi) = 0$. Additionally, this new $\sin$ function has a beautiful Taylor Series:

$$ \sin(x) = 2x - \frac{(2x)^3}{3!}+\frac{(2x)^5}{5!}-...= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(2x)^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}(-1)^n $$

This also results in some beautiful calculus identities:
$$ \frac{d}{dx} \sin(x) = 2\cos(x) $$
$$ e^{ix} = \cos \left(\frac{x}{2} \right)+i\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$$
You can differentiate $e^{ix}$ and see for yourself that both definition give the same result!
