<H1> The Proper $\pi$ Manifesto</H1>
<H2> Preface </H2>
<p>
</p>
<H2> The circle constant </H2>
Recent debates about the proper definition for the circle constant are.
</p>
<H2> Darians are the best measure for angles</H2>
<p>The $\pi$ vs $2 \pi$ debate began when a people started noticing that a bunch of classical equations include the constant $2\pi$. For this reason, some started suggesting that we should replace $\pi$ with $2 \pi$ to clean up this mess, thinking that $\pi$ is the problem. But $\pi$ is not the problem, and redefining it is not the solution. $2 \pi$ shows up a whole lot as a result of using Radians. Radians are the problem, and fixing radians is the solution. 
<p> Radians are a unit for measuring angles. An angle in radians is the length of the arc along a circle with radius $1$. The circumference of such circle is $2\pi$, and this results in $2\pi$ being the length of a full turn. This means that a single turn it twice the circle constant, which is absurd. This is not the way we should go about defining angles. 
</p>
<p>
The proper way to define angles is to use the arc of a unit circle with a <b>diameter </b>of length $1$. The circumference of this unit circle is exactly $\pi = 3.1415926...$. An angle $\alpha$ would be defined as the length of the arc along this circle. This is a simpler and much more natural definition for angles. One immediate consequence is a quarter of a turn being $\frac{\pi}{4}$, and the same is true for all parts of a circle.
</p>
<p>
We will call this system for measuring angles "Darians". Instead of the $rad$ symbol defining angles in radians, we would use the Greek letter Digamma $\digamma$. For example, half a turn would be written as $\frac{\pi}{2} \digamma$.

<H2> The Diameter is the fundamental property of a circle</H2>
<p>
The reason darians are better measure for angles is that <b>the diameter is the fundamental property of the circle</b>. Rectangles aren't measured by distance from their center! neither do triangles. The radius of a circle is not even a directly measurable property. The diameter is. It is a measurable property that is representative of the size of a shape. Thus, the Greeks knew what they were doing while defining the circle constant as:
$$ \pi = \frac {Circumference}{Diameter} $$
</p>
<p>
Which holds for any circle.
</p>
<H2> Calculus agrees </H2>
<p>
Using this definition for angles, we get a better definition for $\sin (x)$ that uses Darians. For example $\sin (0)=\sin(\pi) = 0$. Additionally, this new $\sin$ function has a beautiful Taylor Series:

$$ \sin(x) = 2x - \frac{(2x)^3}{3!}+\frac{(2x)^5}{5!}-...= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(2x)^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}(-1)^n $$

This also results in some beautiful calculus identities:
$$ \frac{d}{dx} \sin(x) = 2\cos(x) $$
$$ e^{ix} = \cos \left(\frac{x}{2} \right)+i\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$$
You can differentiate $e^{ix}$ and see for yourself that both definition give the same result. You would also notice that $ e^{i\pi} = -1$.
</p>
<H2> Gaussian Redemption </H2>
<p>
A standard Gaussian distribution is usually written as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}} $. But this should be substituted to include only $\pi$. It is well known that $ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$, a simple result that includes only a single $\pi$ (something you might be expecting at this point). This is derived by calculating:
 
 $$ \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \right)^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \cdot \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-y^2} dy = \iint_\mathbb{R^2} e^{-x^2 -y^2} dA$$

</p><p>
 Using the proper darian Jacobian $dA=2rdrd\theta$, and substituting $u=r^2$ with $du=2rdr$ we get:

$$ ֿ\int_0^{\infty}\int_0^\pi e^{-r^2}2rdrd\theta=ֿ\int_0^{\infty} e^{-u}du \int_0^\pi d\theta = \pi $$

</p><p>
This result encourages us to define the standard Gaussian as $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}$ fixing the historical fascination with $\sqrt{2\pi}$ and resulting in:

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}} dx = 1$$
