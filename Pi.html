<H1> The Proper $\pi$ Manifesto</H1>
<H2> The Circle Constant Debate </H2>
<p> Being the passionate mathematicians we are, we found the $\pi$ vs $2\pi$ debate frustrating. Each side has their points, but every purposed change seem to brake more than it fixes. After a lot of deliberating we think we have this debate figured out, and would like to purpose a new, elegant solution.</p>
<p>$\pi$ is the all important circle constant, and it should be the only circle constant we use. To make maths clear and simple, we must use it properly, something we haven't been doing.</p>
<H2> Radians are a bad measure for angles</H2>
<p> Radians are a unit for measuring angles. An angle in radians is the length of the arc along a circle with radius $1$. The circumference of such circle is $2\pi$, and this results in $2\pi$ being the length of a full turn. With this definition,a single turn becomes twice the circle constant. This is absurd, and evidently this factor of $2$ haunts us throughout mathematics. To fix this, some suggested that we should redefine $\pi$ to be $2\pi$, but this is not the solution. Radians are the problem, and fixing them should be the solution.
</p>
<p>
The proper way to define angles is to use the arc of a unit circle with a <b>diameter </b>of length $1$. The circumference of this unit circle is exactly $\pi = 3.1415926...$. An angle $\alpha$ would be defined as the length of the arc along this circle. This is a simpler and much more elegant definition for angles. One immediate consequence is a quarter of a turn being $\frac{\pi}{4}$, and the same is true for all parts of a circle.
</p>
<p>
We will call this system for measuring angles "Darians". Instead of the $rad$ symbol defining angles in radians, we would use the Greek letter Digamma $\digamma$. For example,  half a turn would be written as $\frac{\pi}{2} \digamma$.
</p>

<H2> The Diameter is the fundamental property of a circle</H2>
<p>
The reason darians are better measure for angles is that <b>the diameter is the fundamental property of the circle</b>. Rectangles aren't measured by distance from their center! neither do triangles. The radius of a circle is not even a directly measurable property. The diameter is. It's a measurable property that is representative of the size of a shape. Thus, the Greeks knew what they were doing while defining the circle constant as:
$$ \pi = \frac {Circumference}{Diameter} $$
</p>
<p>
Which holds for any circle.
</p>
<p>
Looking at the diameter clears up a whole lot of calculations. For instance, the circumference of a unit circle is exactly $\pi$. Similarly, the surface area of a unit sphere (i.e. a sphere with diameter $1$) is exactly $\pi$. Looking at the diameter clears up both definition of length and surface:
$$ C_{2d} = d \cdot \pi \ \ ; S_{3d}   = d^2\cdot \pi $$
Where $d$ is the diameter,  $C$ is the circumference of a $2d$ sphere (a circle) , and $S$ is the surface area of a $3d$ sphere.

<H2> Calculus agrees </H2>
<p>
Using this definition for angles, we get a better definition for $\sin (x)$ that uses Darians. For example $\sin (0)=\sin(\pi) = 0$. Additionally, this new $\sin$ function has a beautiful Taylor Series:

$$ \sin(x) = 2x - \frac{(2x)^3}{3!}+\frac{(2x)^5}{5!}-...= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(2x)^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}(-1)^n $$

This also results in some beautiful calculus identities:
$$ \frac{d}{dx} \sin(x) = 2\cos(x) $$
$$ e^{ix} = \cos \left(\frac{x}{2} \right)+i\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$$
Notice how these factors of 2 were hiding all along in our Radians notation.  You can differentiate $e^{ix}$ and see for yourself that both definition give the same result. You would also notice that $ e^{i\pi} = -1$.
</p>
<H2> Factors of 2</H2>
<p> Radians insistence that a full turn is $2\pi$ results in factors of 2 hiding in notation all over maths. A way to fix it is to redefine the standard exponential function to include those factors. This redefinition lets us introduce a new constant:
$$ e^{2(ix)} = \cos(x) + i \sin(x) = l^{ix} $$
Setting $l = e^2$. This is a useful definition, and since this constant appeared in some of the work done by the French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre, it is appropriate to name it 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_constant"> Legendre's Constant</a>. Similar to our new $\sin$ definition Legendre's constant has the property $\frac{d}{dx} l^x = 2l^x $.
</p>
<H2> Gaussian Redemption </H2>
<p>
A standard Gaussian distribution is usually written as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}} $. The reader should notice the horrendous $\sqrt{2\pi}$ factor. The Gaussian distribution has the property that for every real $\sigma$ the integral of the distribution over the real number line equals $1$. We would derive this result using Darians, and see that the $2 \pi$ factor shouldn't have been there in the first place. </p>
<p>
We begin by finding the value of $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx$. This is done by squaring the integral:
 
 $$ \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \right)^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \cdot \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-y^2} dy = \iint_\mathbb{R^2} e^{-x^2 -y^2} dA$$

</p><p>
 Using the proper Darian Jacobian $dA=2rdrd\theta$ and simple substitution $u=r^2$ with $du=2rdr$ we get:

$$ ֿ\int_0^{\infty}\int_0^\pi e^{-r^2}2rdrd\theta=ֿ\int_0^{\infty} e^{-u}du \int_0^\pi d\theta = \pi $$

</p><p>
This result encourages us to define the standard Gaussian as $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}$ fixing the historical fascination with $\sqrt{2\pi}$ and resulting in:

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}} dx = 1$$
</p>
<p>
A possible alternative definition uses Legendre's Constant that was mentioned above to finally arrive at a standard Gaussian distribution: 
$$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}l^{\frac{-x^2}{(2\sigma)^2}}$$
