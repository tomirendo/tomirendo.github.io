<H1> The Proper $\pi$ Manifesto</H1>
<H2> Preface </H2>
<p>
</p>
<H2> The circle constant </H2>
</p>
<H2> Radians are a bad measure for angles</H2>
<p>The $\pi$ vs $2 \pi$ debate began when people noticed a bunch of classical equations include the constant $2\pi$. For this reason, some started suggesting that we should replace $\pi$ with $2 \pi$ to clean up this mess, thinking that $\pi$ is the problem. But $\pi$ is not the problem, and redefining it is not the solution. $2 \pi$ shows up a whole lot as a result of using Radians. Radians are the problem, and fixing radians is the solution. 
<p> Radians are a unit for measuring angles. An angle in radians is the length of the arc along a circle with radius $1$. The circumference of such circle is $2\pi$, and this results in $2\pi$ being the length of a full turn. This means that a single turn is twice the circle constant, which is absurd. This is not the way we should go about defining angles. 
</p>
<p>
The proper way to define angles is to use the arc of a unit circle with a <b>diameter </b>of length $1$. The circumference of this unit circle is exactly $\pi = 3.1415926...$. An angle $\alpha$ would be defined as the length of the arc along this circle. This is a simpler and much more elegant definition for angles. One immediate consequence is a quarter of a turn being $\frac{\pi}{4}$, and the same is true for all parts of a circle.
</p>
<p>
We will call this system for measuring angles "Darians". Instead of the $rad$ symbol defining angles in radians, we would use the Greek letter Digamma $\digamma$. For example,  half a turn would be written as $\frac{\pi}{2} \digamma$.
</p>

<H2> The Diameter is the fundamental property of a circle</H2>
<p>
The reason darians are better measure for angles is that <b>the diameter is the fundamental property of the circle</b>. Rectangles aren't measured by distance from their center! neither do triangles. The radius of a circle is not even a directly measurable property. The diameter is. It's a measurable property that is representative of the size of a shape. Thus, the Greeks knew what they were doing while defining the circle constant as:
$$ \pi = \frac {Circumference}{Diameter} $$
</p>
<p>
Which holds for any circle.
</p>
<p>
Looking at the diameter clears up a whole lot of calculations. For instance, the circumference of a unit circle is exactly $\pi$. Similarly, the surface area of a unit sphere (i.e. a sphere with diameter $1$) is exactly $\pi$. Looking at the diameter clears up both definition of length and surface:
$$ C_{2d} = d \cdot \pi \ \ ; S_{3d}   = d^2\cdot \pi $$
Where $d$ is the diameter,  $C$ is the circumference of a $2d$ sphere (a circle) , and $S$ is the surface area of a $3d$ sphere.

<H2> Calculus agrees </H2>
<p>
Using this definition for angles, we get a better definition for $\sin (x)$ that uses Darians. For example $\sin (0)=\sin(\pi) = 0$. Additionally, this new $\sin$ function has a beautiful Taylor Series:

$$ \sin(x) = 2x - \frac{(2x)^3}{3!}+\frac{(2x)^5}{5!}-...= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(2x)^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}(-1)^n $$

This also results in some beautiful calculus identities:
$$ \frac{d}{dx} \sin(x) = 2\cos(x) $$
$$ e^{ix} = \cos \left(\frac{x}{2} \right)+i\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)$$
Notice how these factors of 2 were hiding all along in our Radians notation.  You can differentiate $e^{ix}$ and see for yourself that both definition give the same result. You would also notice that $ e^{i\pi} = -1$.
</p>
<H2> Factors of 2</H2>
<p> Radians insistence that a full turn is $2\pi$ results in factors of 2 hiding in notation all over math. A way to fix it is to redefine the standard exponential function to include those factors. This redefinition lets us introduce a new constant:
$$ e^{2(ix)} = \cos(x) + i \sin(x) = l^{ix} $$
Setting $l = e^2$. This is a useful definition, and since this constant appeared in some of the work done by French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre, it is appropriate to name it 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_constant"> Legendre's Constant</a>. Similar to our new $\sin$ definition Legendre's constant has the property $\frac{d}{dx} l^x = 2l^x $.
</p>
<H2> Gaussian Redemption </H2>
<p>
A standard Gaussian distribution is usually written as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}} $. But this should be substituted to include only $\pi$. It is well known that $ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$, a simple result that includes only a single $\pi$ (something you might be expecting at this point). This is derived by calculating:
 
 $$ \left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \right)^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \cdot \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-y^2} dy = \iint_\mathbb{R^2} e^{-x^2 -y^2} dA$$

</p><p>
 Using the proper darian Jacobian $dA=2rdrd\theta$, and substituting $u=r^2$ with $du=2rdr$ we get:

$$ ֿ\int_0^{\infty}\int_0^\pi e^{-r^2}2rdrd\theta=ֿ\int_0^{\infty} e^{-u}du \int_0^\pi d\theta = \pi $$

</p><p>
This result encourages us to define the standard Gaussian as $ \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi\sigma^2}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}}$ fixing the historical fascination with $\sqrt{2\pi}$ and resulting in:

$$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi \sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{\sigma^2}} dx = 1$$
