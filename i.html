<H1> $i$ is NOT $\sqrt{-1}$</H1>
<p>
Many mathematicians, and generally people who should know better, often describe $i$ as the square root of $-1$.</p>
<H3> We should stop this. $i$ is not $\sqrt{-1}.$</H3> 
<H2> The $\sqrt{}$ operator </H2>
<p> The square root operator ($\sqrt{}$) is only defined for non-negative integers. Therefore, the square root of a number is unique.  </p>
<H2>"The" Root of $-1$</H2>
<p>
Since $-1$ is not a positive real number, it is meaningless to talk about "the" root of $-1$. $-1$ has two equally good roots : $i$ and $-i$. 
</p>
<H2> Complex Roots </H2>
<p>Every number $z\ne 0 $ in the complex plain $\mathbb{C}$ has exactly 2 roots. For a real positive number $a\gt 0 $ there are exactly two solutions to the equation:
$$   x^2 - a = 0 $$ 
Since this equation can be rewritten as $(x-\sqrt{a})(x+\sqrt{a}  ) = 0$, we say that $\pm \sqrt{a} $ are roots of this equation. In this notation $\sqrt{a}$ is a unique positive number.  
 </p>
 <p>
 The equation $x^2 + a =0$ can also be written as $(x-i\sqrt{a})(x+i\sqrt{a})=0$, and this equation also has $2$ distinct roots.
 </p>
 <p>
 A similar solution can be found for every complex number $z=a+ib$. For example if $b>0$, the equation $x^2 - (a+ib) = 0$ is precisely  :
 $$   (x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\sqrt{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}+a} +i\sqrt{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}-a})\right)(x - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\sqrt{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}+a} +i\sqrt{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}-a})\right)  =0 $$
A similar formula can be derived for $b < 0$.
